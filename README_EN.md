#### Developer's Note
The AI Video Creation Assistant originated from an idea I had earlier this year. As someone who loves reading, I prefer to convert video content into text for easier re-reading and reflection. However, I couldn't find a suitable tool for this purpose on the marketâ€”most tools required login and payment, which I didn't like. So I decided to create one myself, giving birth to the AI Video Creation Assistant.

### Features:
- Completely open source, supports local deployment, no login or registration required, task records saved locally.
